Single Queue Multi-Server Modeling and Simulation of Tim Hortons

Queuing theory is the study of waiting in a line and to predict how long the customer
waits in the queue and making smart decisions to wait in the queue for the short time.
Customers must wait in the queue and nobody wants to wait in the line, and so we must
find the strategies to wait for a shorter time in the queue. Queuing theory is the
mathematical analysis of queues and waiting times in a stochastic system. These stochastic
systems have been used extensively to analyze the production and service processes
demonstrating random variability in service times and arrival times.
The need for queue arises when the short-term demand for service exceeds the
capacity and most often it is caused by random variation in service times and inter-arrival
time of the customer. If there is long term demand for service, then the capacity of the
queue will overflow. In this project, we studied the queuing system of Tim Hortons and
simulated the same using Pro-Model. The model is a single queue with two servers system
G/G/2. We collected data during rush-hour, analyzed data, then simulated the behavior of
the system using Pro-Model, validated the simulation model using T-test and implemented
the simulation model, analyzed the outputs and conducted the cost analysis of the system.
